# Excel Chart for Timeline or Milestone 

For a project manager, a timeline chart is very useful to illustrate the project progress: what is completed, what is outstanding.
- An excel chart is especially useful and can be embedded into outlook emails. 
- You can update the progress by updating the data table. As time elapses, your progress keeps updated
