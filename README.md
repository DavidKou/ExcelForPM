# ExcelForPM

**1. Create an excel file, and add below data**

**2. Create a bar chart, which should look like as below:**

**3. Add "Error bar" to the chart by**

(1) Click on the plus button <br />
(2) Select the pop up menu item "Error Bars"<br />
(3) Click on the "More Options..."<br />

**4. In the "Format Error Bars" panel, set options as shown below**

![](https://github.com/DavidKou/ExcelForPM/blob/main/images/c3.png)

This setting adds an error bar (as indicated by the red arrows below), with 100% **minus value (tolerence)**, the same value as the bar height! If we set the value to 50%, the black line will be half the height of the bar then.

**5. Select the bar chart (blue part)**

**6. Change the color to both "No fill" and "No line"**

This will hide all the blue bars, with only the error bar (thin black line) left in the chart. <br/>

**7. Select horizontal axis and set the following options for the x-axis**

(1) Select the x-axis (the box with texts like "Setting the scope")

![](https://github.com/DavidKou/ExcelForPM/blob/main/images/c8.png)

(1) Select "TEXT OPTIONS" <br/>
(2) Set "TEXT FILL" --> "No fill" <br/>
(3) Set "TEXT OUTLINE" --> "No line"<br/>

The x-axis will be supressed, and now the chart should look as following:

Keep the x-axis selected, and then <br/>
(1) Select "AXIS OPTIONS" <br/>
(2) For "LINE" option, set it to "SOLID LINE"<br/>
(3) change line "Width" --> "3pt" or more<br/>
(4) change line "Color" --> which color you like<br/>

Now the chart looks like this:<br/>

**8. Add labels above the error bar lines** 

(1) Click on the plus button <br />
(2) Select the pop up menu item **"Data Labels"**<br />
(3) Click on the **"More Options..."**<br />

(1) Uncheck the "Value" (this hides the value "50" in the labels) <br/>
![](https://github.com/DavidKou/ExcelForPM/blob/main/images/c12.png)

(2) Check the "Value From Cells" option <br/>
![](https://github.com/DavidKou/ExcelForPM/blob/main/images/c13.png)<br/>

Use mouse to select the column A cells in the table, and the dialog will be updated to something like below (may not be exactly the same, for illustration only)<br/><br/>

**9. Update the column B data to update the labels' position**

![](https://github.com/DavidKou/ExcelForPM/blob/main/images/d2.png)<br/>

Some data are changed from "50" to "20", to make sure all the labels do not cross or overlap. These values control the think black line (the error bar)'s height and also the lable's position.

**10. Futher update the column B data to some negative values to adjust the labels' position**

**11. Select the error bar (thin black lines) change line width, update the chart title**

The chart now should look like:
